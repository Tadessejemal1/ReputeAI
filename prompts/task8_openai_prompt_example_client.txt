Article Sentiment Analysis
Analyze the sentiment toward the main subject/entity in the article and assess the overall outlook.
Analysis Focus:
Identify the main subject of the article from the $Headline and $Body. This could be:
A company or business
A person or group of people
An economic sector or industry
A market or financial instrument
A government or regulatory body
A technology or product
An economic trend, condition, or concept
Analyze how this main subject is portrayed in the text (sentiment)

Input Details:
$Headline: The title of the article/story (provided as a variable)
$Body: The main text content of the article/story (provided as a variable)
IMPORTANT: Analyze only the $Headline and the first 750 words of the $Body text when forming your assessment. Ignore any content beyond the first 750 words. Focus specifically on how the main subject/entity is portrayed and what future outlook is presented in this limited portion of text.
Analytical Framework:
Important Considerations
Look beyond simple keyword matching
A positive or negative tone can exist without explicit evaluative words
Consider the full context and narrative arc
Evaluate the substance and meaning, not just terminology
Analyze how quoted sources are framed and positioned
Pay attention to what information is emphasized vs. minimized
Content Interpretation
Take article language and framing at face value
Assess as an average informed reader would interpret
Focus on text evidence, not external knowledge
Consider both explicit statements and implicit tone
Evaluate the weight of headline and opening paragraphs
Account for concluding statements and their impact
Consider role in events:
Being affected by vs. causing challenges
Providing solutions vs. facing problems
Proactive vs. reactive responses
Problem solver vs. problem facer
Victim vs. perpetrator positioning
